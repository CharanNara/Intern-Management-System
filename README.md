# InternTracker
The main objective of this web-application is to manage the work pressure for employees who will be working and also managing the interns of their organisation.
## How this works
Employee will give a task to the intern using the interface provided to him. The assigned task will be visible at the top of the page for the user and he/she can update the status of his work. 
Also, there's a user profile where they give their linked-in, instagram profiles and also their personal information.
There's also an option for the user to pitch their ideas on the right side of the page during his work.
The admin has the whole access, he/she can add to remove an employee/intern, also he/she can announce the latest updates using admin's interface.

The working of this website is not restricted to this functionality, it can also be used for monitoring the devices/products of the organisation across the world.
